Each documentation file is self-contained but cross-references related topics. Use the table of contents at the top of each file for quick navigation to specific sections.

For Claude Code development, start with the main [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) file which provides essential context and then dive into specific documentation as needed.
